        <p>Lithium is an element with the Li symbol.</p>
        
        <p>The atomic number is 3.</p>
        
        <p>It was discovered in 1817 by Johan August Arfvedson.</p>
        
        <p>Lithium is a soft silver metal which is used in rechargeable batteries inside your phone and laptop.</p>
        
        <p>When lithium gets added to water it fizzes away and eventually disappears!</p>
        
        <p>Lithium got its name from a Greek word 'lithos' which means stone.</p>
