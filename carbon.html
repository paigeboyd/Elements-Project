<h1 id="maintitle">Carbon</h1>
        
        <p>Carbon is an element with the C symbol.</p>
        
        <p>The atomic number is 6.</p>
        
        <p>Carbon was discovered in prehistoric times, so we have no idea who found it first!</p>
        
        <p>Carbon is found in the sun and stars as well as charcoal, graphite, fossil fuels and diamonds!</p>
        
        <p>Carbon is constantly cycled through the Earth in the oceans, plants, animals and the atmosphere.</p>
        
        <p>Carbon got its name from a Latin word 'carbo' which means charcoal.</p>
